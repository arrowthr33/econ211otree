In the 1994 study "Bertrand-Edgeworth Competition in Experimental Markets" by Kruse, J.B., Rassenti, S., Reynolds, S.S., and Smith, V.L., published in Econometrica, the traditional Bertrand competition model is explored and expanded through experimental markets. This influential research investigates how market participants behave in a controlled setting where traditional economic theories, such as the Bertrand model, predict price competition leading to prices equal to marginal costs. By setting up experimental markets and allowing participants to interact under varying conditions, the study provides valuable insights into the nuances of price setting behavior, the impact of limited resources, and the strategic interactions between competitors. These findings offer a more comprehensive understanding of market dynamics, challenging and refining the predictions of classical economic models by introducing real-world complexities and behavioral considerations into the analysis of competitive markets.
